# TictactoeTNN
Topological neural network based Tictactoe AI
##Description
- This is a Topological neural network structure, it also has the input layer, hidden layer and output layer.
The difference between the neural network structure and the topological neural network is the hidden layer.
Hidden layer is no longer like an array structure, it is a topology. This means that any node can connect to any other node in hidden layer.
- In the first step, I need to test whether the structure can be used to play Tictactoe. The hard code structure shows what human intelligence can do.
- The next step is to let AI self-training. There will be more tests later.
- Topological neural networks have been studied, such as [NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).
